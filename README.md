Hello,

My name is Pandurang Pampatwar. My preferred email id would be pandurang.anil.pampatwar@smu.ca.

I have a professional experience of 3.5+ years of experience in IT industry. I have mostly worked with python and PQL(Papyrus query language). So far I have worked with two organizaitions i.e. Accenture and WonderBiz Technologies. At Accenture, I worked as a software developer. The tool I worked in there has the version control system similar to Github. At Wonderbiz, I worked on python and machine learning projects. The machine learning project was related to preventive maintenance. I am not familiar with languages such as java, asp.net, c#, etc.

While working as a machine learning engineer, I came to know that I am lacking some important coneceptual knowledge related to data analytics. This thing encouraged me to enroll in this program so that I will cover the necessary conecpts and then can apply in practical.
